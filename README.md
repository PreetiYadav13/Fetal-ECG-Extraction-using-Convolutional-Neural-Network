# Fetal-ECG-Extraction-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
CNN-based model for non-invasive fetal ECG extraction, isolating fetal heart signals from abdominal recordings with high accuracy. The model reduces noise and signal overlap, evaluated using correlation and MSE, enabling early detection of fetal cardiac issues and improving prenatal care accessibility.
